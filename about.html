            Netflix is an American subscription video on-demand Internet streaming service. The service primarily distributes original and acquired films and television shows from various genres, and it is available internationally in multiple languages.[6]

Launched on January 16, 2007, nearly a decade after Netflix, Inc. began its pioneering DVD‑by‑mail movie rental service, Netflix is the most-subscribed video on demand streaming media services, with over 269.6 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries as of April 2024.[5][7] By 2022, "Netflix Original" productions accounted for half of its library in the United States and the namesake company had ventured into other categories, such as video game publishing of mobile games via its flagship service. As of October 2023, Netflix is the 23rd most-visited website in the world with 23.66% of its traffic coming from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom at 5.84% and Brazil at 5.64%.[8][9]

In February 2018, Netflix acquired the rights to The Cloverfield Paradox from Paramount Pictures for $50 million and launched on its service on February 4, 2018, shortly after airing its first trailer during Super Bowl LII. Analysts believed that Netflix's purchase of the film helped to make the film instantly profitable for Paramount compared to a more traditional theatrical release, while Netflix benefited from the surprise reveal.[178][179] Other films acquired by Netflix include international distribution for Paramount's Annihilation[179] and Universal's News of the World and worldwide distribution of Universal's Extinction,[180] Warner Bros.' Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle,[181] Paramount's The Lovebirds[182] and 20th Century Studios' The Woman in the Window.[183] In March, the service ordered Formula 1: Drive to Survive, a racing docuseries following teams in the Formula One world championship.[184]

In March 2018, Sky UK announced an agreement with Netflix to integrate Netflix's subscription VOD offering into its pay-TV service. Customers with its high-end Sky Q set-top box and service will be able to see Netflix titles alongside their regular Sky channels.[185] In October 2022, Netflix revealed that its annual revenue from the UK subscribers in 2021 was £1.4bn.[186]
